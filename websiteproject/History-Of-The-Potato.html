    <h2>Origins of the Potato</h2>
    <p>The potato was first domesticated in Peru and Bolivia between 5000 and 8000 BC. The earliest verified archeological site for potatoes was at the site of Ancon, a city on the coast of Peru.     <img src="http://www.crystalinks.com/incamap2.jpg">

    <p>Potatoes were first brought back to Europe by Spanish sailors who brought them back to Europe. The leftover studs were then planted on the coast where they landed. Potatoes were then used by the Spanish empire in North America as their main food crop. This was then used by the peasants around.</p>

    <p>However, people were not allowed to plant potatoes in large fields as the Spanish only allowed grains to be planted within the large fields. Meanwhile, French and Germany gave more and more land for creating potatoes, which allowed to have less hunger.</p>

    <h2>Irish Potato Famine</h2>
    <p>During the years of 1845 and 1852, a potato famine occured, meaning that no one could eat the potato as the potato was infected. Potato Blight was the cause of the famine and it ravaged a lot of Europe. Within Europe, Ireland was hit the hardest. 1/3 of all the Irish relied on the potato as their main food crop. During this, many Irish migrated to America and were discriminated against.</p>
