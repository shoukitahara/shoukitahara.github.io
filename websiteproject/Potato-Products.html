    <h2>Potato Dishes</h2>
    <p>My personal favorite dish would be potato fries covered in cheese and hashbrowns. I personally really enjoy fried foods and so it would make sense for me to like all the fried foods. Also potatoes are pretty good baked and then you add a topping of sour cream and bacon.</p>
